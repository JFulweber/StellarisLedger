# StellarisLedger
Planet ledger for stellaris. Some stuff doesn't work.
I know the code is awful and could've probably be written more efficiently in every aspect, but this is my first java program, and I am a noob. 
If you see something that could've been done better, please, make a comment or whatever. I'm a noob to github too.

If you're wanting to download it, go to this link https://github.com/intoxicatedpenguin/StellarisLedger/raw/master/Stellaris%20Ledger.jar to get the .jar file. To run it, you need have java installed of course.
